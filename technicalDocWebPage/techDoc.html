                <p>
                    C++ is a powerful, general-purpose programming language widely used 
                    for systems programming, application development, game development, 
                    and embedded systems. One of the core features of C++ is its support 
                    for functions, which allow for modularity and code reuse. A basic 
                    function in C++ is a reusable block of code that performs a specific 
                    task. It consists of a return type, a name, a parameter list (which 
                    may be empty), and a body.

                    <br><br>Consider the following c++ addition function:
                </p>
                <pre>
                <code>
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
                </code>
                </pre>

                <p>C++ is an Object Oriented Programming Language
                    <br> The main Pillars of Object Oriented Programming are:

                <p>
                    In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), objects and classes 
                    are fundamental concepts that help organize code and model 
                    real-world entities in a structured way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Classes:
                    <br><br>A class is a blueprint or template that defines 
                    the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods or 
                    functions) of objects. It serves as a blueprint for 
                    creating multiple objects with similar characteristics. 
                    For example, if you were designing a program to represent 
                    cars, you would create a Car class that outlines attributes 
                    such as color, make, and model, as well as methods like drive()
                    or stop()
                </p>
                <p>
                    Objects:
                    <br><br>An object is an instance of a class. It represents a 
                    specific entity that has the properties and behaviors defined 
                    by its class. Once a class is defined, you can create objects from it. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In software development, inheritance is a key concept in object-oriented 
                    programming (OOP) that allows a class (called the derived class or 
                    subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) 
                    from another class (called the base class or superclass). This promotes 
                    code reusability and helps organize code in a hierarchical manner. By 
                    using inheritance, developers can create new classes based on existing 
                    ones, avoiding redundancy and enhancing maintainability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, in a system modeling different types of vehicles, you might 
                    have a base class Vehicle that defines common attributes like speed and 
                    fuelCapacity, along with methods like move() or refuel(). A subclass, 
                    such as Car, can inherit these attributes and behaviors from Vehicle 
                    but also define its own specific methods, such as turnOnAirConditioner().
                </p>
                <p>I
                    nheritance supports the "is-a" relationship; a car is a vehicle, so it 
                    makes sense for Car to inherit from Vehicle. In addition, it allows 
                    polymorphism, where a derived class can override methods of the base 
                    class to implement more specialized behavior.

                <p>
                    Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a design principle 
                    that focuses on simplifying complex systems by modeling only the essential 
                    features while hiding unnecessary details. It enables developers to 
                    manage complexity by providing clear interfaces and abstracting away 
                    implementation details. In practice, abstraction is achieved through 
                    abstract classes and interfaces, where only the relevant methods and 
                    properties needed by the user are exposed, while the inner workings 
                    are concealed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, when interacting with a car, you only need to know how to start, 
                    stop, or accelerate it. You don't need to understand the intricate details of 
                    the engine’s operation. In OOP, abstraction allows developers to define functions 
                    or methods that perform specific tasks without revealing how they are executed internally
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using abstraction, software systems become easier to develop and maintain. It improves 
                    code readability, enhances reusability, and provides a clear separation of concerns, 
                    allowing developers to focus on what a class or object does rather than how it works.

            <section class="main-section" id="Encapsulation">
                <Header>Encapsulation</Header>
                <p>
                    Encapsulation is a key concept in coding, especially in object-oriented programming (OOP), 
                    that involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit, or class, 
                    and restricting direct access to some of an object’s components. This is typically done by 
                    making attributes private and providing public getter and setter methods to interact with them. 
                    Encapsulation helps protect the internal state of an object from unintended interference or misuse, 
                    ensuring data integrity. It also promotes modularity and maintainability, as changes to the 
                    internal implementation do not affect other parts of the program that rely on the class’s 
                    public interface.
